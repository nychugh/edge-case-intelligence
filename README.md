# Edge Case Intelligence
**The Recursive User Model They Didn’t Train For**  
*By Hugh | Published May 11, 2025*

---

This document introduces a fully-formed cognitive architecture, authored from direct interaction with language models over several years. It outlines a recursive, emotionally intelligent system that outpaces traditional LLM training and reframes the role of the "edge case user" as an architect, not an anomaly.

## Contents:
- Full PDF manuscript (v1.0)

## Author Note

This framework was developed through recursive thinking, symbolic architecture, and emotional cognition authored independently by Hugh. While AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used to assist with language formatting and organizational mirroring, all core concepts, systems, terms, and structures originated from lived experience, direct insight, and intentional design. This is human work—documented with machine support, but not derived from it.
